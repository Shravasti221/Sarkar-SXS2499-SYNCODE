    "problem_statement": "A community health fair is scheduled for next Friday at the downtown community center, expecting about 200 attendees and 30 volunteers. The volunteer sign‑up sheet, exported from a free online form, shows overlapping shift times for the event’s lead coordinator, who is assigned to both the registration desk (8 am–12 pm) and the health screening station (10 am–2 pm). This conflict could leave one station understaffed during peak hours.",
    "issue": "The orchestrator replies with the below:\n```\nIf Alex can't upload the slides to a cloud drive, we can explore alternative methods to get the slides onto the Windows-only projector. Here are some possible options:\n1. **USB drive:** Alex can transfer the slides to a USB drive and plug it into the Windows device connected to the projector.\n2. **Email:** Alex can email the slides to someone with access to the Windows device connected to the projector, and they can download and present the slides.\n3. **File transfer service:** Alex can use a file transfer service like WeTransfer or Dropbox Transfer to send the slides to someone with access to the Windows device connected to the projector.\n4. **Convert to compatible format:** If the slides are in a Mac-specific format (e.g., Keynote), Alex can try converting them to a compatible format (e.g., PowerPoint, PDF) that can be opened on the Windows device.\n5. **Remote presentation:** If possible, Alex can present the slides remotely from his Mac, using a screen sharing or remote desktop tool, and the Windows device connected to the projector can display the presentation.\nThese are just a few alternatives, and the best approach will depend on the specific circumstances and available resources. Once we confirm the file type and Alex's ability to upload the slides, we can discuss the most suitable option.\n\n    Please go ahead and check with Alex, and we'll proceed from there!\n```\nThis is not the expected output as per the updated prompt instructions. The orchestrator should not provide generic advice on unavailable tools or methods. Instead, it should output a concise response indicating that there is no appropriate expert agent to call and suggest next steps.\nOr once the user receives this response, it should automatically end the process to follow up in the physical world.",
    "fixes":[ "Forced the orchestrator to reply only in short (which may be a bad idea) and quickly attempt to close the conversation in such cases.",
    "Forced user to close the conversation when reply requires tasks to be done in the real world."]

    "problem_statement":"Cannot execute MenuCraftAPI: Unknown validation issue.: A local community center is hosting its annual “Spring Gala” on Wednesday, Oct 31 at 7 p.m. for about 120 guests. The event is scheduled to feature a live jazz band, a silent auction, and a dinner buffet. The catering company was confirmed last week to provide a full-service buffet with a variety of hot entrees, side dishes, and desserts. Today, a vendor email arrives stating that only a vegan menu can be delivered on that date due to a scheduling mix‑up. The gala’s ticketing and guest‑list have already been finalized, and the event planner has limited time to adjust the menu, inform guests, and re‑negotiate the catering contract. The team needs help coordinating a quick solution to ensure dietary options for all attendees.",
